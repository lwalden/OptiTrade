## Sprint Planning

When the user asks to start a sprint or begin a phase:

1. Read `docs/strategy-roadmap.md` for the phase's features and acceptance criteria.
2. Read `PROGRESS.md` for current state, what's done, and any blockers.
3. Read `DECISIONS.md` for architectural context that affects implementation choices.
4. Decompose the next chunk of work into discrete issues. Each issue must be completable in a single focused effort — small enough that you don't need the entire codebase in context. One PR per issue.
5. Each issue must have: a title, a type (feature/fix/chore/spike), acceptance criteria, and references to relevant strategy-roadmap items or files.
6. Write the proposed sprint to `SPRINT.md` using the active sprint format.
7. Present the sprint to the user as a numbered list. **Wait for the user to review, edit, discuss, and approve before starting any implementation.**

Issue ID format: `S{sprint_number}-{sequence}` (e.g., S1-001, S1-002, S2-001).

## Sprint Execution

After user approval:

- Work issues in the proposed order unless the user directs otherwise.
- For each issue: create a feature branch (`{type}/S{n}-{seq}-{short-desc}`), implement, commit referencing the issue ID (`feat(auth): implement login endpoint [S1-003]`), create a PR. PR description includes sprint number and issue ID.
- After creating a PR, notify the user it's ready for review. **Wait for user input before merging — the user always approves PRs.**
- Update SPRINT.md issue status as you work: `todo` → `in-progress` → `done` or `blocked`.
- If an issue cannot be completed (missing info, unfinished dependency, needs human action): mark it `blocked` in SPRINT.md, add the blocker to PROGRESS.md Blockers, and notify the user with a clear description of what's needed.

## Sprint Completion

A sprint ends when all issues are `done` or `blocked`.

- If blocked issues exist: notify the user and wait for resolution. Once all blocks are resolved, complete remaining issues, then proceed to review.
- Present a sprint review: completed issues with PR links, decisions logged to DECISIONS.md, summary of what was accomplished, and what remains for the next sprint.
- If the user accepts the review: archive the sprint — replace SPRINT.md contents with a single summary line (see archived format). Update PROGRESS.md with sprint outcome. Full sprint detail is preserved in git history.
- The user can then ask to begin a new sprint. Increment the sprint number.

## Cross-Session Behavior

- SPRINT.md persists across sessions via git. When resuming a session with an active sprint, read SPRINT.md to understand which issues remain and continue from where you left off.
- `/handoff` works independently — it checkpoints current state including any active sprint. Do not modify SPRINT.md during handoff; sprint state is updated during sprint execution.
